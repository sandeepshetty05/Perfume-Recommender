A perfume recommender system is a type of recommendation system that 
suggests perfumes to users based on their preferences and past interactions 
with perfumes. These systems can help users discover new scents that they 
might not have found otherwise, while also reducing the time and effort 
required to find a perfume that matches their preferences.
Machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based 
filtering, and deep learning can be used to build perfume recommender 
systems. Collaborative filtering uses the similarity between users' 
preferences to generate recommendations, while content-based filtering 
uses the features of perfumes to recommend similar ones
